# World Population Analysis (1970-2022)

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes global population trends from **1970 to 2022**, focusing on various factors such as **population growth rate, country-wise population trends, and world population distribution**. The analysis provides key insights into how populations have changed over time and which countries have experienced the highest growth.

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains **population statistics** of various countries from **1970 to 2022**, including:  
- **Country Name & Code**  
- **Population for different years**  
- **Growth Rate**  
- **World Population Percentage**  

### **Data Source**  
The dataset was obtained from publicly available population statistics.

# Problem Solved
**<==========================================================================================>**
**Identified the top 10 most populated countries from 1970 to 2022.**
**Analyzed population growth rates to determine which countries are growing the fastest.**
**Compared the world population percentage share of different countries over time.**
**Provided data-driven insights for understanding global demographic shifts.**
**<=========================================================================================>**


## **Objectives & Insights**  

### **1. Finding the Most Populated Countries (1970-2022)**  
- Countries like **China and India** consistently held the top spots in terms of population.  
- The United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan followed in terms of global population contribution.  
- China's population peaked in **2022**, while India's growth rate remained steady.  

### **2. Analyzing Growth Rate Trends**  
- Countries like **Moldova, Poland, and Niger** showed the **highest population growth rates** over time.  
- Developing nations have exhibited **rapid growth**, whereas **developed nations** show slower population increases.  

### **3. World Population Distribution**  
- **China and India** together hold **more than 35%** of the worldâ€™s population.  
- Countries like **the USA, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Nigeria** have significant contributions but at a much lower percentage.  

### **4. Top 10 Countries by Population in Different Years**  
- The ranking of countries based on population has changed significantly over the years.  
- **Countries like Nigeria and Bangladesh have climbed in rankings**, while **Russia and Japan have declined**.
