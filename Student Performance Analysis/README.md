# 📊 Student Performance Analysis Based on Race/Ethnicity and Parental Education

This project analyzes student performance across three key subjects — **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing** — based on:
- **Race/Ethnicity**
- **Parental Level of Education**

It provides visualizations and insights to identify performance gaps, influence of parental education, and suggests possible trends in gender-based academic strengths (e.g., female performance in reading and writing).

## 📥 Dataset Description

The dataset used includes:
- **Student performance scores** in Math, Reading, and Writing.
- **Demographic features**: race/ethnicity groups, parental level of education.
- (Optional columns not used here: gender, lunch type, test preparation)

## 📈 Key Insights from the Analysis

### 1. Race/Ethnicity Group Performance:
- **Group E** students consistently achieve the **highest scores** in all subjects.
- **Group A** shows the **lowest average performance**, especially in math.

### 2. Parental Education Impact:
- Students whose parents hold **Bachelor's or Master's degrees** have significantly **higher average scores** 📚.
- Those with parents who did not complete high school are consistently at the bottom of the score range 📉.

### 3. Subject-wise Trends:
- **Reading and Writing scores** are generally **higher than Math** across all groups.
- Performance variance is largest in **Math**, indicating a need for math-focused support programs.

### 4. Female Performance Insight (Inferred):
- Although gender is not explicitly analyzed, based on educational research:
  - Females typically **excel in reading and writing** 🧠✍️
  - The high performance in these subjects suggests a **strong female contribution**.

## 📊 Visualizations

Charts are generated to visualize:
- Math, Reading, and Writing scores across different **race/ethnicity groups**.
- Grouped bars representing each **parental education level**.



Each bar includes error lines showing the distribution of scores.
